## Description
This website is meant for all of the book worms out there!  It allows you to easily search for any book, and be able to see it's authors, a short summary, and the book cover.  If you're logged in there's even more functionality!  Simply login or signup and you will be able to save books that you want to see later, and once you have read them you can easily delete them from your account.

## Usage
Using the website is very user friendly.  When you first load the page, you will see a search bar.  If you choose not to sign in or sign up, you can still search for any book in that search bar, pressing submit search or the enter key to view the results.  The books will be displayed underneath, and you can scroll down to read more about them.  When you sign up or sign in, you will now be able to save books to your account.  All you have to do is hit the "Save this Book!" button below the desired choice and it will be added to your account.  When you have saved all the books you wanted to, hit the "See Your Books" tab in top right corner to see all of the books saved.  If you decide to delete one, simply click on the "Delete this Book!" button and it will be removed from your account!
